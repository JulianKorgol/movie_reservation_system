## ‚è≥ GitLab Flow

We follow GitLab Flow best practices for collaboration.

GitLab Flow combines Git Flow and GitHub Flow by adding environment-specific branches, making it easier to track deployments while staying simpler than full Git Flow.

### Branch-es

`main` branch is always stable, deployable

`production` branch is to integrate all features for the next release

`type/<short-description>` branches are for specific features, fixes, chores, or docs

### Branch syntax

We use clear prefixes for branches:

- `feature/<short-description>` -> new features
- `chore/<short-description>` -> maintenance tasks that don‚Äôt affect app features or docs
- `fix/<short-description>` -> bug fixes
- `docs/<short-description>` -> documentation changes

## üîí Security
- `admin/` -> Should be locked on production.
- `docs/` -> Should be locked on production.
- `schema/` -> Should be locked on production.
