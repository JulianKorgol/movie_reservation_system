## ‚è≥ GitLab Flow

We follow GitLab Flow best practices for collaboration.

GitLab Flow combines Git Flow and GitHub Flow by adding environment-specific branches, making it easier to track
deployments while staying simpler than full Git Flow.

### Branch-es

`main` branch is always stable, deployable

`production` branch is to integrate all features for the next release

`type/<short-description>` branches are for specific features, fixes, chores, or docs

### Branch syntax

We use clear prefixes for branches:

- `feat/<short-description>` -> new features
- `chore/<short-description>` -> maintenance tasks that don‚Äôt affect app features or docs
- `fix/<short-description>` -> bug fixes
- `docs/<short-description>` -> documentation changes

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

We enforce **Conventional Commits** using [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/).  
This ensures consistency and makes it easier to generate changelogs and track changes.

### ‚úÖ Commit Message Format

Each commit message should be structured as:

```
<type>: <short, lowercase description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:

- `feat: add user login API`
- `fix: correct typo in README`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `docs: add contribution guide`

### Allowed commit types

- **feat** ‚Üí new features
- **fix** ‚Üí bug fixes
- **chore** ‚Üí maintenance tasks that don‚Äôt affect app features or docs
- **docs** ‚Üí documentation changes
- **refactor** ‚Üí code restructuring without changing behavior
- **test** ‚Üí add or fix tests

### Rules

- Subject **must not** be empty
- Subject **must** be in **lowercase**
- Max length: **100 characters**

‚ö†Ô∏è Commits that don‚Äôt follow this format will be **rejected** by Husky + commitlint.

<b>Remember to run `npm i` in root directory after cloning the repo to install Husky.</b>

## üèÉ User Flow

Possible user flow to interact with the system.

### General Reservation Process

<b>Goal:</b> Allow a customer to browse available movies, select a showtime, reserve specific seats, and complete the
reservation.

Flow steps:

1. Select Cinema Location
    - User selects preferred cinema from a list of available locations.

2. Choose movie and showtime
    - User views list of movies playing at the chosen location.
    - User selects a movie ‚Üí shows all available showtimes (with date, time).
        - User should be able to see movie list with showtimes on one page.

3. Select ticket type and seat
    - User chooses desired number and type of tickets (Standard, VIP, Student, etc.).
    - Seat map is displayed for chosen showtime.
    - User selects seats on the map.
        - Backend should lock (hold) these seats temporarily to prevent over-booking.
        - Backend returns a temporary reservation token

4. Review reservation summary
    - User reviews selected movie, showtime, seats, ticket type, and price breakdown.
    - Option to go back and modify selection.

5. Confirm reservation
    - User confirms reservation ‚Üí backend finalizes booking.
    - Backend checks if seat locks are still valid, then marks them as reserved.
    - Reservation record is stored, and confirmation email is sent.
    - Optional: Redirect to payment gateway (if enabled).

#### Seat Hold Mechanism (Critical Logic)

- When a user selects a seat, the frontend must call the backend to lock/hold that seat.
- Backend stores the lock in DB with a short expiration (e.g., 5 minutes).
- If the user confirms within the expiration window, the reservation is created and the hold is converted into a
  booking.
- If the lock expires, the seats are released and become available again.
    - Do not show to User (Flow) that seats hold expired if the token expires and seats are still free to take (user is
      still in the reservation process).

### Home Page

- Location selector ‚Üí leads to available movies page.
