### Branch-es

`main` branch is always stable, deployable.

`dev` branch is to integrate all features in one place, just for devs.

### Branch syntax

We use clear prefixes for branches:

- `feature/<short-description>` -> new features
- `chore/<short-description>` -> maintenance tasks that don’t affect app features or docs (example: chore/dependency-upgrade)
- `fix/<short-description>` -> bug fixes
- `docs/<short-description>` -> documentation changes
